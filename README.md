# Parking Lot Project

This project focusses on implementing a  parking lot system with **object-oriented principles** in Java.

## Overview

The project consists of several classes representing key components of a parking lot system:

- `ParkingLot`: Represents the overall parking lot, containing a list of levels.
- `Level`: Represents a parking level with rows and parking slots, responsible for finding available spots and parking cars.
- `ParkingSlot`: Represents an individual parking slot with specific coordinates and the ability to occupy or clear the slot.
- `Car`: Represents a car with a license plate.

## Object-Oriented Principles Applied

### Encapsulation

- Private fields are used to encapsulate the internal state of classes, promoting data hiding.
- Getter and setter methods are provided for controlled access to attributes.

### Inheritance & Polymorphism

- Inheritance & Polymorphism is not heavily utilized in this project due to its simplicity. However, I am planing to extend it by introducing specialized types of cars or parking slots.

### Abstraction

- Classes and methods are designed to abstract away the complexity of the parking system, providing a clear interface for external use.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-project.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Explore the classes and methods to understand the object-oriented design.

## Future Enhancements

- Introduce more advanced features like different types of vehicles.
- Implement efficient algorithms for spot allocation.
- Integrate ticketing system.
